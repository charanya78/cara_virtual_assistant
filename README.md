# CARA - Virtual Assistant

### DESCRIPTION 

The aim of the project is to design a virtual assistant with voice input and output that can perform basic functions like web browsing, playing music,opening applications etc. On interfacing with sensors and hardware, it is capable of performing home automation features also. This project was done as a part of Object Oriented Analysis and Design (CS7503).The home automation features implemented here have a hard coded temperature/ water level value which can be automated to be taken from home automation devices. Design Patterns are used and UML diagrams are drawn. The diagrams can be found on the CaraReport.docx file.
